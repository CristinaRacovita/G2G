# E-voting System

- Web application that integrates smart contracts & blockchain for implementing a secure voting method

## Fundamental Theory
### Distributed Ledger Technology
- A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a decentralized network
- Participants in the network govern and agree by consensus on the updates to the records in the ledger
- No central authority
### Blockchain Introduction
- Shared digital ledger that records transactions in a peer-to-peer network
- Transactions are permanently record in a sequential chain of cryptographic hash-linked blocks
### Smart Contracts
- Collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the blockchain
- Can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code
- Cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible
### NEAR
- NEAR is a collective, a foundation, and a development platform built on a new layer-one blockchain
### Project Arhitecture
